🦠 COVID-19 Pandemic Analysis in India Dashboard
1. Project Title / Headline
🦠 COVID-19 in India: Tableau Dashboard for Pandemic Monitoring and Impact Analysis
An interactive Tableau dashboard that visually tracks and analyzes the spread, containment, healthcare response, and impact of COVID-19 across Indian states during the pandemic.

2. Short Description / Purpose
The COVID-19 in India Dashboard provides a clear and interactive view of the progression of the pandemic, enabling health analysts, policymakers, and the public to monitor cases, deaths, recovery rates, testing levels, and vaccination progress across different time periods and regions in India.

3. Tech Stack
This Tableau project was built using the following technologies:

📊 Tableau Desktop – Primary platform used for dashboard development and visualization

📂 Tableau Prep – For cleansing and transforming raw data for analysis

🧮 Calculated Fields – Used for metrics like active cases, recovery %, positivity rates, CFR, etc.

📁 File Format – .twbx for packaged Tableau workbook, .png/.pdf for reports or dashboard sharing

4. Data Source
Source: Ministry of Health & Family Welfare (India), COVID19India.org API, Kaggle (COVID-19 India datasets)

Data includes:

Daily confirmed, active, recovered, and deceased cases

Testing and vaccination statistics

State-wise, district-wise, and national-level data

Mobility and lockdown phases (optional layers)

Data from March 2020 to late 2021 or 2022

5. Features / Highlights
Business Problem
The government, health authorities, and citizens required a real-time, visual understanding of COVID-19's spread and control measures across India for better public health response and resource allocation.

Goal of the Dashboard
To create a tool that:

Tracks and compares COVID-19 trends over time and across regions

Highlights testing and vaccination performance

Assists in understanding mortality, recovery, and healthcare effectiveness

Helps identify surges and containment zones through geographic visualization

Walkthrough of Key Visuals

📍 Interactive Map of India

Choropleth or symbol maps showing state-wise confirmed, active, and recovered cases

📈 Daily and Cumulative Trends

📊 State Comparison Charts

Bar charts and heatmaps comparing states by key metrics (e.g., total deaths, recovery %, case fatality rate)

🧮 Key Metrics Panel

Active Cases, Total Cases, Recoveries, Deaths, Fatality Rate, Recovery Rate

📆 Filter Options

Filter by state, time range (e.g., first wave, second wave), vaccine type, testing phase

Business Impact & Insights

🏥 Policy & Healthcare Planning: Guided lockdown decisions and medical resource allocation

🧪 Testing Strategy: Helped track regions with low testing or high positivity

🧬 Vaccination Monitoring: Assessed vaccine distribution equity across regions
